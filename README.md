This is (was?) a shield definition for the byomcu variant of the [vulpes minora keyboard](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vulpes-minora) to enable use of this keyboard with [zmk firmware](https://zmk.dev/).
As noted, this shield has been merged upstream, and the latest version with additional enhancements can be found there.  
This version is only useful for checking the keymatrix.
